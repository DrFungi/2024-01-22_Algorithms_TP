## Topics learned

I learned how to create structs in C#, and I discovered how versatile they are
for creating custom datatypes as an example I only had to use 3 variables 
(lists) to gather all information from the client and the sales person 
from the travel agency.
The use of lists helped me understand how to create one, how to insert info
into it, how to read its contents and finally how to add and delete items from it.
From what I learned, there are many more methods that I can use with lists
and now I feel more prepared to use them if the opportunity comes

## Problem description

For this exercise we had to create a program that helps a travel agent to keep
track of clients and travel plans. The person does this through a menu that can
add new clients, sell travel plans, add new travel plans, and remove travel plans;
the travel agent also has the option to delete travel plans and to show the plans
during the day.
Each travel plan contains a destination, transport, accomodation and recreational
activities. Inside each of the above items, there are several other categories.


## Challenges encountered

Naming conventions were particularly challenging. My IDE (Rider)kept telling
me to rename the variables and functions and I understood that there were some 
naming conventions but I did not follow them in this project.
