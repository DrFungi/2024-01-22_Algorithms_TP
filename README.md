## Topics learned

I learned how to create structs in C#, and I discovered how versatile they are
for creating custom datatypes as an example I only had to use 3 variables 
(lists) to gather all information from the client and the sales person 
from the travel agency.
The use of lists helped me understand how to create one, how to insert info
into it, how to read its contents and finally how to add and delete items from it.
From what I learned, there are many more methods that I can use with lists
and now I feel more prepared to use them if the opportunity comes

## Problem description

For this exercise we had to create a program that helps a travel agent to keep
track of clients and travel plans. The person does this through a menu that can
add new clients, add new travel plans, and remove travel plans; the travel agent
also has the option to delete travel plans.

## Problem solution

## Challenges encountered

Naming conventions were particularly challenging. My IDE (Rider)kept telling
me to rename the variables and functions and I really did not understand why
